# Clock Generation and Distribution

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of **clock generation and distribution systems** for integrated circuits. The aim is to ensure **precise timing**, **low power consumption**, and **robust performance** in both **digital** and **mixed-signal** environments. The project encompasses **digital, analog, and mixed-signal concepts**, with practical modules designed for each domain.

## Digital Concepts

### Key Concepts:
1. **Clock Division**: Implementing clock dividers to generate lower-frequency clocks from a high-frequency reference clock.
2. **Setup/Hold Constraints**: Analyzing and resolving timing violations to ensure data stability during clock transitions.
3. **Clock Gating**: Reducing dynamic power consumption by disabling the clock signal for idle components.
4. **Clock Signal Integrity**: Addressing issues like clock skew, jitter, and cross-talk in distribution networks.

### Modules:
- **Clock Divider**: Parameterized design to generate specific frequencies.
- **Setup/Hold Time Analyzer**: Simulates and identifies timing violations.
- **Clock Gating Unit**: Implements enable signals to control clock activity.
- **Clock Integrity Checker**: Monitors skew, jitter, and cross-talk.
